## 🎯 Course Description

This course teaches the process of exploring and analyzing data, from understanding datasets to incorporating findings into a data science workflow. Using real-world datasets (e.g., unemployment figures and plane ticket prices), you'll learn to:

- Summarize and validate data.
- Handle missing values and clean numerical/categorical data.
- Create stunning Seaborn visualizations to understand variables and relationships.
- Generate hypotheses and suggest next steps for data insights.
